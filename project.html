    <p>1. At the end of 15th century European trade relied on gold and spices from Asian continent. At the end of the 15th century, it was nearly impossible to reach Asia from Europe by land. The route was long and arduous, and encounters with hostile armies were difficult to avoid.

    <p>3. Columbus finally arrives in Hispaniola Island modern day Haiti and Dominican Republic, and back then he thought that he had reached India. By thinking that he had arrived in India, he named local people of the island Indians. His exploration and desire for gold led to the complete depopulation of local people in Hispaniola Island because they were very susceptible to European diseases. </p>

    <p>2. Since the War cost a lot of money for British, British parlament decided to impose various taxes and acts on 13 colonies which deeply enraged majority of the colonists. These acts led to Gaspee incident, Boston Massacre, Boston Tea Party.</p>

  <p>3. Soon after the fighting broke out in Massachusetts, delegates to the Second Continental Congress met in Philadelphia. One group of delegates argued that colonies should declare independence, another group advocated for peaceful negotiations and reconciliation with the British</p>
